For what values of $\alpha$ is the solution defined for all time?
(Hint: You may need to treat $\alpha =0$ and $\alpha \neq 0$ separately.)

\soln* The solution is undefined when the denominator, $\over{\alpha} - \sin(t) = 0$. Rearranging this into $\over{\alpha} = \sin(t)$, this has an infinite number of solutions when $\over{\alpha} \in [-1, 1]$. This occurs when $\abs{\alpha} \geq 1$, therefore the solution exists for all time when $\abs{\alpha} < 1$ and $\alpha \neq 0$ (since we cannot divide by zero).

\nl Thus, a solution exists for all $t$ when $\abs{\alpha} < 1 \land \alpha \neq 0$.
