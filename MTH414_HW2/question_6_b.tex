(BVP without a solution) For $\phi(x) \equiv x$, show that no solution exists. 

\soln* 
$u(x, y) = f(ye^{-x})$ and $u(x, 0) = f(0) = \phi(x) = x$

\nl $f(0) = k$ for some constant $k \in \R$, but $\phi(x) = x \; \forall \; x \in \R$.

\nl The alleged solution curve $y_1 = k$ and BVP of $y_2 = \phi(x) = x$ Clearly $y_1 \neq y_2 \; \forall \; x \in \R$ since the intersection is at $(k, k)$.
