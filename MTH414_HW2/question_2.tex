Solve the equation $2u_t + 3u_x = 0$ with the auxiliary condition $u = \sin x$ when $t = 0$.

\soln* Using the general solution $u(t,x) = f(bt-ax)$ then $u(t,x) = f(3t-2x)$. Evaluated at $t =0$ yields $u(0,x) = f(-2x) = \sin x$. Letting $w = -2x \iff x = -\over{2}w$ gives $f(w) = \sin \pars{-\over{2}w}$ and substituting $w$ back gives the final solution $u(t,x) =  \sin \pars{-\over{2}\pars{3t-2x}}$
