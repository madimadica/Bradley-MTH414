In which region of the $xy$-plane is the solution the to IVP in (a) uniquely determined? (Hint: Recall that data is transported along characteristic curves. Look at the characteristic curves and think about what happens to the data of our initial condition.)

\soln* The region where a unique solution exists will be at the intersection of the characteristic curves and the auxiliary condition. That is, $x=0 \cap \R^2 \equiv \{(x,y) \mid x = 0\}$.
