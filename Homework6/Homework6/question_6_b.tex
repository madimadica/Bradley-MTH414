Show that the problem has a single negative eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ if and only if $hL > 1$, in which case $\lambda_0 = - \beta_0^2 /L^2$ and $y_0 = \sinh \beta_0 x/L$, where $\beta_0$ is the positive root of the equation $\tanh x = x/hL$. (Suggestion: Sketch the graphs of $y = \tanh$ and $y = x/hL$)
